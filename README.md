## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

- Complete this lab which challenges them on what they have learned about arrays up to this point.
- This should actually reflect what it is we're looking to cover here (similar to the outlines provided in the labs I mentioned in the outline below).

## What the student can do at this point

- Create variables and constants
- Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
- Can create functions with return types.
- Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
- Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
- Understands if and else clause statements.
- Can create and use Arrays.
- Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
- Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
- Work with the following methods on arrays:

  - `append()`
  - `insert(_:atIndex:)`
  - `removeAtIndex()`
  - _subscript syntax_ with arrays
  - `count`
  - `isEmpty`

## Outline / Notes

- I'm including labs written for the iOS immersive course here that you can reference (or flat our steal) They were written in Objective-C which this course is not! They are labs that students seemed to like in the immersive program. They also serve as a good reference for what a **lab** actually should look like. You can see how we structure the lab with regards to the instructions as well as how the tests are written.
- [WWDC Badges With Methods - OBJ-C](https://learn.co/tracks/ios-new/objective-c-basics/basic-structures/wwdc-badges-with-methods)
- [Deli Counter Lab - OBJ-C](https://learn.co/tracks/ios-new/objective-c-basics/basic-structures/deli-counter)
- [Array Practice - OBJ-C](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/objc-array-practice)
- [Boat - SWIFT](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-boat) <-- This is not a lab about arrays, but it is a lab written in Swift where you can reference how the the tests were written using Quick & Nimble.

- I've included the Xcode project which includes the Quick & Nimble frameworks installed using CocoaPods. You should work within the .xcworkspace file, NOT the project file.
